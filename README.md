### Hi there 👋

<!--

My name is Ferran Noguera Vall, I'm a data engineer 👨🏻‍💻 born and raised at @UPC BarcelonaTech. Hope you enjoy your stay and maybe drop some ⭐ if you like what you see.

A piece of myself:
- 🔭 I’m currently working as a Data engineer @restbai
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any open-source project.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning anything related to Big data and Machine learning.
- ⚡ Fun fact: with some friends we created a GitHub organizatino for catalan related open-source projects in @Boucat
